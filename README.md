# AdapTable React Support Template

This is a very basic example of how to get started with AdapTable React.

AdapTable React is the React Framework version of AdapTable - the market-leading, low-code AG Grid extension from AdapTable Tools.

This template is particularly useful if you wish to build a very small demo for Support purposes.

For full information on how to use AdapTable React see the [AdapTable Documentation](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/react-overview).

## Versions and Dependencies

The demo is built using these key packages:

- [AdapTable](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/) version 19
- [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com) version 32.1
- [React](https://react.dev/) version 18

## Contents

This template contains just the bare bones required to set up an AdapTable instance. 

A "real world" example would most likely also include:

- Design-time - providing [Adaptable Options](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/reference-options-overview) and [Predefined Config](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/reference-predefined-config) to configure the application
- Run-time - using the [Adaptable API](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/reference-api-overview) and listening to [Adaptable Events](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/reference-event-overview)

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `yarn`), depending on what tool you're using.

## Running for development

Execute the following command

```sh
$ npm run start
```
